# Greenhouse Automation Project

## Overview
This project aims to automate a home greenhouse using a combination of sensors, controllers, and power sources. The goal is to create a self-sustaining system that monitors and regulates environmental conditions to optimize plant growth.

## 1. Power Source
### Options:
- **Wind**
- **Water**
- **Solar**

### Recommendations:
- **Solar Power:** The most practical option for a home greenhouse. Use solar panels to charge a battery that powers the system.
- **Battery:** A 12V LiPo battery is recommended. Calculate the required capacity based on power consumption needs.
- **Battery Management System (BMS):** Ensure compatibility with the battery voltage and include protections like overcharge, discharge, and short-circuit.

## 2. Controller
### Option:
- **ESP32**

### Recommendations:
- The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, ideal for IoT applications.
- **Programming:** Use Arduino IDE or MicroPython.
- **Connectivity:** Utilize Wi-Fi for remote monitoring and control of greenhouse parameters.

## 3. Sensors
### Types of Sensors:
- **Temperature Sensor:** e.g., DHT22 or DS18B20
- **Humidity Sensor:** e.g., DHT22 (combined with temperature) or standalone like SHT31
- **Soil Moisture Sensor:** Capacitive sensors are recommended for durability.
- **Light Sensor (UV):** e.g., ML8511 for UV intensity measurement
- **CO2 Sensor:** e.g., MH-Z19B
- **Battery Level Monitor:** Voltage dividers or dedicated battery monitoring ICs

### Recommendations:
- Ensure all sensors are compatible with the ESP32 in terms of voltage and communication protocol (I2C, analog, etc.).
- Calibrate sensors after installation for accurate measurements.

## 4. Solenoid Valve
### Type:
- **12V DC solenoid valve**

### Recommendations:
- Ensure the valve is rated for the water pressure in your greenhouse irrigation system.
- **Manual Override:** Include a manual valve or switch to enable water flow in case of system failure.

## 5. Human-Machine Interface (HMI)
### Options:
- **LCD/OLED Display:** Use an OLED display for better contrast and visibility in different lighting conditions.
- **Buttons vs. Touch Interface:** Capacitive touch buttons or physical buttons based on personal preference.

### Recommendations:
- Keep the interface simple for easy interaction. Consider a touch interface for ease of use, especially in humid conditions or when wearing gloves.

## 6. Additional Considerations
### Data Logging and Monitoring:
- Store data locally on an SD card or send it to a cloud service for long-term analysis.
- Use MQTT or HTTP protocols to send data to a smartphone or web dashboard for real-time monitoring.

### Automated Irrigation Logic:
- Program the controller to open the solenoid valve based on soil moisture levels.
- Include threshold settings for temperature and humidity to trigger ventilation or heating systems.

### Backup Power:
- Consider a secondary power source (like a backup battery) to keep essential systems running during power failures or extended periods without sunlight.

### Environmental Controls:
- Integrate with fans or heaters to maintain optimal temperature and humidity levels.
- Potential integration with grow lights for low-light conditions.

## 7. Future Expansions
### Advanced Automation:
- Implement machine learning algorithms to optimize watering schedules based on historical data.

### Security:
- Implement a camera system to monitor the greenhouse remotely.

## 8. Development and Testing
### Prototyping:
- Start with a basic setup including the power source, ESP32, and one or two sensors.
- Test the systemâ€™s response to different environmental conditions.

### Iterative Improvement:
- Gradually integrate additional sensors, automation features, and the HMI.
- Continuously refine the control logic based on testing outcomes.

## 9. Implementation and Maintenance
### Installation:
- Ensure all components are weatherproof or protected from the greenhouse environment.

### Maintenance:
- Regularly check battery health, sensor calibration, and system operation.
